\title{Binning function of radiocarbon dates.}
\usage{
binPrep(sites, ages, h)
}
\arguments{
\item{sites}{a vector of character strings (or number to coerce to character) of all sites or site phases}

\item{ages}{a vector uncalibrated conventional radiocarbon ages}

\item{h}{a single numeric value passed to \code{\link{hclust}} control degree of grouping of similar ages in a phase site.}
}
\value{
A vector of character strings of length(ages) that identifying intra-site or intra-phase grouping, for use with spd()
}
\description{
Prepare a set of bins for controlling the aggregation of radiocarbon dates
known to be from the same phase of same archaeological site (for use with \code{\link{spd}}). Used in cases where there is a concern that unusually high levels of sampling for radiocarbon at a given site or in a given site phase will impede comparison between sites or phases.
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{spd}} for generating SPD; \code{\link{binsense}} for sensitivity analysis pertaining the choice of the parameter \code{h}.
